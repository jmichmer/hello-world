The immemorially ancient introduction from Brian Kernighan.
And here is another opportunity to mess something up.  I'm reminiscing about my first encounter with the C Programming Book, back around 1979.  But I've had trouble just now committing my edits.
I have many memories of that book.  I read it through three or four times before every getting my hands on a C compiler.
